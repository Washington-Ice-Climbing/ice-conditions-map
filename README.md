# ice-conditions-map
Interactive map showing crowdsourced ice climbing conditions and photos.

## Getting started
Install dependencies:
```.env
npm install
```
Run the app:
```.env
npm run dev
```
The app should launch in a browser. It will reload on changes to any file in the `pages` or `components` directory.

### Adding dependencies
For normal deps:
```.env
npm install <dep> --save
```
If it's only for development (like testing) do:
```.env
npm install <dep> --save-dev
```
