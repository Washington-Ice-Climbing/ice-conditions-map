    On the first ascent, Doug and Ben began at the gravel pit on the Little Wenatchee River Rd. Walk past the gravel pit
    and cross the Little Wenatchee River. The river is pretty wide and slow here, so it does freeze in exceptional cold snaps.
    If the river is not frozen, you could try a raft, but realistically, if the river is not frozen, the route likely is
    not in. Continue up through pine trees and a creekbed to the base of the first pitch at about 3000 ft.

    A possible alternative approach that avoids crossing the river is to start near Hidden Lake to the east. You might
    not be able to drive all the way to the Hidden Lake trailhead in winter if there is snow or gates, so check with locals.
    Then traverse westward about 1 mile, maintaining elevation, before joining the standard approach.
