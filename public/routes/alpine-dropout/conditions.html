    Although its name is "Alpine Dropout", this route could easily be named "Alpine Enigma". It takes very specific conditions
    to come in. The window for this climb is late November to December during a very hard freeze but before significant
    snowfall. Snow will bury this climb and increase avalanche hazard.

    Doug had a cabin on Lake Wenatchee for a decade and only observed this route come in climbing condition once during
    that period. It can be easily observed from the far side of Lake Wenatchee at the intersection of Highway 207 and
    the Little Wenatchee River Road.
