    The FA party traversed Nason Ridge down to the Round Mountain trail, eventually meeting up with a car there. They reported
    very slow post holing and would not recommend this route for others.

    The most direct descent would be to simply descend down the south side of Nason Ridge to US2. The upper section has
    some cliffs, so be careful here. Be sure to scout the descent from below when you leave your car shuttle.

    Alternatively, one could likely rap the route on V-threads after the technical ice pitches are finished.
