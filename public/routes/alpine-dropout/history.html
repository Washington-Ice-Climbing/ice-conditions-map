    For about a decade, Doug Hutchinson had a cabin on Lake Wenatchee. He observed this route every year,
    waiting for the perfect conditions. In December 2009, the perfect storm of extremely cold weather and minimal
    snowfall created the opportunity. With Ben Hargrove, Doug climbed Alpine Dropout in a long day and immediately knew
    he had found something truly special.
