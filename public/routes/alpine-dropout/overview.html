    Among alpine ice routes in Washington, Alpine Dropout is an outlier. The route climbs at least 7 distinct frozen
    waterfalls as it winds up a steep gully above Lake Wenatchee. The climbing - pure water ice, stepped, varied -
    is more reminiscent of the legendary Professor Falls in the Canadian Rockies or the iconic Mousetrap in British Columbia.

    This route is very challenging to get in condition and might come in just once in a decade. However, the patient
    climber will be rewarded with pitch after pitch of stellar water ice in a setting that is close to civilization, yet subtly
    alpine. Alpine Dropout is the type of climb that a die-hard Cascade ice climber might chase for years before
    finally getting on, but will leave them with an incredible sense of satisfaction and appreciation for what
    might be the most unique ice route in the Cascades.
