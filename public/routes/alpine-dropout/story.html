        "I'm bracing for the collective yawn and "oh boy, another WI3 in 11worth," this route is so much more unique
        than a typical Leavenworth dribble to nowhere. A 4000 feet plum line with over 1000 of quality ice
        ending on a remote ridge. Seemed similar to longer climbs in Lillooet or longer moderates in the Canadian Rockies."
