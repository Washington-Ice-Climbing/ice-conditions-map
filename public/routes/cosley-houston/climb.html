    <b>Pitch 1:</b>
    Climb 65m up low angle ice or snow, depending on conditions, to the base of the crux pillar. Be considerate of where
    you set the belay to avoid being in the line of fire from sluffing from above.

<p>
    <b>Pitch 2:</b>
    This is the crux pitch, the money pitch. Take a few warm up swings, then launch into the pillar. This ice pillar is
    dead vertical or slightly overhung for approximately 30-40 feet. Most people find it to be more challenging and pumpier
    than expected. Above this pitch either build a belay in the snow above, or stop just short of the last ice move and
    build a screw belay. We recommend the latter so that you can have your follower on a solid belay.

    <b>Pitch 3:</b>
    Continue up steep 50 degree snow for another rope length. There is generally no protection here.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 4:</b>
    The second crux is a vertical 20 ft ice step to the left. It is often thin and difficult to build an anchor above,
    so many parties will choose to bypass this step on steep, exposed neve to the right.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 5:</b>
    Continue up more steep 50-60 degree snow towards the summit. There are two gullies near the top. Either will lead
    you eventually to the flat summit plateau.
