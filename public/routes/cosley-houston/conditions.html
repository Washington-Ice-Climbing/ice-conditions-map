    Because of its high elevation and northern aspect, this climb is often climbable for over half the year.
    During a cold fall it comes in in October and can last into May. The ice is usually thinner and more technical
    in the fall. The crux pitch is especially cruxy when lean or chandiliered. Be prepared to bail if it is not
    safe to climb.

    During a dry fall, it is often easy to approach the entire climb in mountain boots and crampons, although the glacier
    and bergschrund beneath the climb can present more difficulties. During the spring, the glacier approach will be much
    easier and flotation is usually required.

    The slopes on the actual climb are steep enough that they shed regularly. The most avalanche prone slopes are the
    slopes right beneath the climb and the traversing on the descent off Colfax Peak.
