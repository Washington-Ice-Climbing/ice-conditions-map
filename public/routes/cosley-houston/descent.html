    For the descent, walk down the east ridge of Colfax Peak. Traverse across the south side of the sub summit.
    Then follow approximately the ridgeline down to the Coleman Glacier, although you may have descend slightly to the north
    of this ridge and navigate through some crevasses and a bergschrund. Some parties report having to make
    a rappel over this bergschrund.

    Once on the Coleman Glacier, follow the standard Coleman-Deming route back down to your cache at 8100 ft.
    Continue down to the Heliotrope trail or the Grouse Creek drainage, if it is still snow covered. In good weather, this descent
    is usually very fast, especially with skis.
