    A typical rack is 5-8 screws, maybe a picket, possibly a light rock rack (pins, small nuts and cams). The rock is
    generally very poor, but some parties report rock gear useful. A single 60m rope should be adequate.
    Crevasse rescue gear is obviously important.

    In the spring or very late fall, skis will greatly expedite the approach and descent.
