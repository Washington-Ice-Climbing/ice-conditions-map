    In alpine climbing, the focus is usually not on an individual pitch, but rather the entire climb and the setting. Although
    it has a beautiful position and quality climbing throughout, Cosley Houston is definitely infamous for just a single pitch:
    its 40 ft crux ice pillar. Steep, pumpy, intimidating, deceptive; these are all frequently used adjectives to describe
    what might be the most famous pitch of ice in the North Cascades.

    Beyond a vertical pillar at 9000 ft, Cosley Houston has much more to offer: a solid 800 ft of varied, sustained,
    thrilling climbing in a beautiful setting. Look across to massive Mt. Baker or the San Jaun Islands dotting the Salish
    Sea. This route has been praised as the best alpine ice route in Washington. It has deservedly become a classic,
    almost a yearly tradition for many Cascade ice climbers.
