    Begin at the farthest Alpental Parking lot and follow the skin track to Source Lake.
    Please be respectful of the ski area's request to not approach through the avalanche control zone.
    At Source Lake, skin/snowshoe up into Great Scott Basin through the No Fog Trees. Traverse up and right on
    an angled slope beneath the southeast face of Bryant. A traverse beneath the northeast face leads to Bryant Col
    on the north side of Bryant.

    From the col, descent a few hundred feet through steep trees before emerging beneath the northwest face of Bryant Peak.
    The edge of the trees is a good place to stash skis or snowshoes. Then traverse climber's right until beneath
    the fattest flow, just left of center on the face. Other first pitch options exist, but Hot Tubbs is the fattest flow.
