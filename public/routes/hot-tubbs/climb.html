    <b>Pitch 1:</b>
    Climb 20-30m through the vertical ~WI4- ice crux. Belay from ice screws at an intermediate stance partway
    up the ice.

<p>
    <b>Pitch 2:</b>
    Climb another 10-20m of easier WI3 ice before reaching steep snow. Continue another 30m up to a group
    of trees, where a belay can be found.

    <b>Pitch 3:</b>
    Climb 80m of steep snow up to the notch just left of the summit. Simul climbing can be helpful here. Belay
    off a dead snag.

    <b>Pitch 4:</b>
    This pitch turns the blind corner onto the northeast face of Bryant. Traverse 60-70 degree snow above cliffs leftwards
    for a bit, slinging small trees as you go. At a constriction, a mixed step allows passage upwards towards the summit.
    Continue up decreasingly steep snow, breaking through the summit to the right of the largest cornices. Although this pitch
    is technically easy, it can be quite intimidating with poor protection.
