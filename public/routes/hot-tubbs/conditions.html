    This climb is likely in condition most commonly from January to March. Like most Snoqualmie ice routes, it can come
    in and out rapidly due to low elevation and temperature fluctuations. The lower ice pitches are fed by freeze thaw
    from the snowfield above, so clear diurnal weather is likely helpful for formation. The first ascent was made
    on a very warm January day (50 degrees in Alpental) but had been preceeded by many weeks of relatively dry, variable
    weather that likely contributed to ice formation.

    Avalanche hazard is present on the approach on all aspects. A lot of unconsolidated powder could make the final pitch
    very challenging and/or hazardous. Even though the face has a northern tilt, it does get afternoon sun. Again, look
    for a warmup followed by hard freeze for the safest conditions.

    The conditions of the ice pitches can be easily evaluated from the base of the route. A neat way to check out
    the route and other flows in the Melakwa Valley is to do the Chair Peak Circumnavigation tour as a scouting mission.
