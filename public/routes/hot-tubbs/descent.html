    Walk down the easy southern slopes of Bryant until you are overlooking the climber's right side of the original
    northwest face of Bryant that you climbed. From here, a single 60m rappel reaches back to the base of the face,
    where you can traverse back to your cached skis or snowshoes.

    On the way out, if conditions are right, you can ski directly down from Bryant Col via Bryant Couloir.
    This is a classic ski descent in itself and would be a fantastic end to the day. However, we know that
    oftentimes good ice climbing conditions and good ski conditions are mutually exclusive.

    It also might be possible to descent to the south and rappel down to the Bryant/Hemlock Col and exit out
    Great Scott Basin. This would be a shorter descent if you carried your gear over.
