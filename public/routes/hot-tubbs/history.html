    Kyle McCrohan first spotted the flows on the northwest face of Bryant Peak while skiing the Chair Peak Circumnavigation
    in January 2019. He texted his partner, Jacob Krantz, who was in Spokane at the time. Two weeks later, they teamed up
    to give the route a go.

    On the approach, Jacob's huge Tubbs snowshoes proved completely inadequate for the refrozen breakable crust while
    sidehilling beneath Bryant Peak. This debacle nearly derailed the entire attempt (which occured on
    a nearly record breaking warm day where it hit 50F in Alpental), so after the climb, they
    decided to name the route "Hot Tubbs" to spite Tubbs. This climb came less than a year after they first learned
    to ice climb together in Hyalite Canyon.

    They camped near Melakwa Lake that night before making the first recorded ascent of an ice route in the "Melakwa Flows"
    above Melakwa Lake the next morning. This group of flows can be incredibly fat and dense, but doesn't come in
    every year and is south facing.
