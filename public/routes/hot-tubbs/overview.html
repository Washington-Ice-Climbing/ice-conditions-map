    While Chair Peak is undoubtedly the alpine queen of the Alpental Valley, lesser-known Bryant Peak is home to its own quality climbs.
    Situated on the NW Face of Bryant, hidden to the crowds farming the slopes above Source Lake, Hot Tubbs is a solid 4 pitch moderate ice route.
    Although conditions cannot be known from the parking lot, as is true for the NE Buttress of Chair, this route definitely deserves attention
    and is very accessible.

    The smaller stature of Bryant Peak holds no relation to the deceptive prowess of this route.
    With a sweet vertical ice crux, wonderful views of Kaleetan and Chair, and an adventurous final pitch, Hot Tubbs packs a punch far above
    its weight and is poised to become a classic route in the Snoqualmie Backcountry. Plus, you get to ski a classic
    couloir, Bryant Couloir, on the way back to your car!
