    <i>"When I poked my head around the corner onto the North Face, I saw 60 degree snow with cliffs beneath.
    I looked back at Jacob and we both knew this was my pitch. This sh*t is what I do.</i>

        I led out, swimming in deep unconsolidated wet snow. I dug my arms and tools in for any security I could find.
        On the leftward traverse, there were little snags to sling every 15 ft or so, for whatever it was worth.
        I came to a mixed step and worked upwards tenuously. A few minutes later, I plowed through the summit cornice
        and onto the summit of Bryant Peak and it was over - the final pitch, so desperate and so beautiful at the same time.
        It was so utterly Cascadian.
