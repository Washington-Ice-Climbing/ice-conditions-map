        "When I poked my head around the corner onto the North Face, I saw 60 degree snow with cliffs beneath.
        I looked back at Jacob and we both knew this was my pitch. I'm not worth for much, but weird scary easy stuff is my jam.
        It's what I do.

        I led out, swimming in deep unconsolidated wet snow. I dug my arms and tools in for any security I could find.
        On the leftward traverse, there were little snags to sling every 15 ft or so, for whatever it was worth.
        Partway through, it occurred to me that a shovel would be more useful than an ice tool.
        I came to a mixed step with thin rotten ice and worked upwards tenuously. A few minutes later, I plowed through the summit cornice
        and onto the summit of Bryant Peak and it was over - the final pitch, so desperate and so beautiful at the same time.
        It was so utterly Cascadian."
