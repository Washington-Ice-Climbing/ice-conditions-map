    Begin at the uppermost Alpental parking lot. Follow the skin track up towards Source Lake. Be sure to heed
    the requests of the ski area to not skin through the blast control zone. Once at Source Lake, evaluate avalanche
    conditions. If you feel it is safe, continue skinning up the valley towards Chair Peak. As you enter the upper basin
    beneath Chair Peak, you will see a rock sticking out called "Thumbtack Rock". This is a good place to cache gear
    like skis or snowshoes.

    From Thumbtack Rock rock, turn right and ascend up a steep snow gully to gain the ridge. Then follow the ridge up
    to the base of the east buttress of Chair Peak.
