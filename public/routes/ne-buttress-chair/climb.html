    <b>Pitch 1A:</b>
    The standard route begins by traversing right and climbing the "S Gully", which snakes its way up and right and then back left
    through a rock band. This pitch usually involves steep snow and a little ice, although there could be some mixed
    climbing in early season conditions. Belay off trees. 60 meters.

<p>
    <b>Pitch 1B:</b>
    An alternative first pitch, if it is in, is to climb 60-70 degree ice just left of the ridge crest. This route is more
    direct, but often is thin or unprotectable. When fat, it is very enjoyable. 40-50 meters.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 2:</b>
    Continue up steep snow to the base of the crux ice step. This pitch might be longer than 60 meters, depending
    on where you set your last belay.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 3:</b>
    Climb the crux ice step, which is usually vertical for a body length or two. Either setup a screw belay above or
    try to bury a picket. This is a short pitch.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 4:</b>
    Continue up moderate snow to the summit ridge. There is a small group of trees near the summit that offers a belay.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 5:</b>
    The summit block is usually about 30 ft of steep, unconsolidated snow. Be wary of cornices on the north east side.

    In general, it seems that oftentimes the greatest challenge of this route is building good anchors, especially when
    the snow is poor.
