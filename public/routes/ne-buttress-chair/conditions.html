    It is generally pretty easy to get eyes on this route from the Alpental Valley and even from the Alpental parking lot with binoculars.
    Because of its low elevation and southern aspect, it may come in and out multiple times per season. The technical
    sections are usually climbable even when there is little ice, although they will be more mixed in nature then.

    The most common concern parties report on this route is large amounts of unconsolidated, unprotectable, un-fun steep snow.
    This area receives a large amount of snowfall of dubious quality. The approach and climb are very avalanche prone.
    Wait for safe conditions to climb. The best conditions are usually preceded by a rain event and then hard freeze.

    Despite the name, the route faces almost due east, with a southern tilt, so it gets a lot of sun. Especially in the spring
    months (March - April), this route can heat up very quickly, kicking off loose wet avalanches on route. Additionally,
    the rappel is beneath a monster south facing cornice, so be wary of warm temperatures.
