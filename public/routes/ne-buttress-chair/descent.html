    From just before the true summit of Chair Peak, descent southwards down a moderate snow couloir for about 200 ft.
    Then turn left at a notch in the ridge to find a rappel anchor. There are multiple rappel anchors for different
    snow depths, but you should be able to use one. Some excavation may be required.

    Make one 30 meter or longer rappel in the southeast direction between a rock wall and cornice down towards Chair Peak basin.
    A 30 meter rappel should get you down to steep snow, but some parties feel more comfortable doing a full 60 meter rappel.
    There is usually an intermediate anchor too, but some parties report it difficult to find or buried in snow.
    From there, hike down back to Thumbtack Rock and ski or walk out.
