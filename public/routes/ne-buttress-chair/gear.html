    The optimal rack on this route can vary greatly. In fatter mid winter conditions, all you need is 4-6 screws and
    a picket or two. In thinner conditions, or if the "S gully" is climbed, parties report that small to mid
    sized cams and pins are useful. A 60 meter rope or doubles ropes will work.

    In most cases, flotation is helpful for the approach and descent. It is a pretty short approach, so some parties
    manage without in firmer conditions.
