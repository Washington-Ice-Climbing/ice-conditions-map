    The Alpental Valley is the centerpiece of winter backcountry recreation in Washington and Chair Peak is the queen of the Alpental Valley.
    Thus, it is only fitting that the NE Buttress, which climbs the right hand skyline of Chair Peak, is the most
    popular winter alpine route in Washington. It is a classic stepping stone for the budding winter alpinist in the Cascades.

    While one can get from downtown Seattle to the base of the route in under three hours, the NE Buttress is still very
    much an alpine route with stunning scenery, moderate climbing, and sustained exposure. Depending on conditions,
    there may only be 15 ft of true ice climbing, but the position and accessibility of this route make it a true
    Cascade Classic.
