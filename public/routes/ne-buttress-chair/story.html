        "Since Jacob and I were both new to skiing, this was our first ice climb in ski boots. I led us up the alternate
        first pitch, simuling on 30 meters of rope. It was perfect, fat 70 degree ice. My feet felt a little strange and
        so I looked down and noticed that my semi-automatic crampons were coming slightly loose. But if I kept frontpointing
        and never turned my foot sideways, it would be okay. So I calf-burned my way up the 45 meters of ice.

        When I eventually brought Jacob up to my belay beneath the crux pitch, he explained to me that while he was
        simul climbing in the back, one of his crampons had almost completely disengaged! He had climbed most of
        the pitch with one foot front pointing, and the other foot sideways. We both tightened our crampons and
        the rest of the climb was must less eventful, thankfully."
