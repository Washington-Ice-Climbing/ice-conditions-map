    This route is climbed car to car in anywhere from 6-12 hours. Speed depends on snow conditions, fitness, how much
    of the route is simul climbed, and how much traffic there is on route. This route is likely the most popular
    winter alpine route in Washington, so expect crowds on a nice weekend.

    The route has two long sections of moderate snow climbing. If parties are comfortable soloing or simul climbing these
    sections, efficiency will be much improved. Anchors are typically difficult to find in these sections.

    Generally, flotation is helpful and can be left at Thumbtack Rock. If there will be sun, start early because
    the route gets a lot of sun.
