    The first pitch is simply to get into the couloir proper. In early season (fall) this pitch is moderate scrambling
    up snow and verglas covered slabs. There is little in the way of protection or positive holds, but the climbing is not
    too hard. In spring, it is simply a snow apron.

    Once in the couloir, continue up ~50 degree snow for a few hundred feet. The couloir twists and turns, hiding
    the challenges around the next corner.

    About halfway up the couloir, there is a cruxy chockstone. The difficulty totally depends on snow depth and in the
    spring, it is completely buried. Surmounting this chockstone might require some delicate mixed or thin ice moves.
</p>
<p>
    Above the chockstone, the couloir offers a brief respite before it narrows and steepens again. More 60 degree snow
    climbing possibly mixed with some AI2 steps leads to the final ampitheater. The climbing is very sustained through here.

    The couloir finishes with two mixed pitches on the right hand side of the couloir. The rock is very crumbly and difficult
    to protect, although the climbing is moderate. Use two tools, one tool, or stash them both. Grovel up the distengrating
    rock however you can. In certain years, there is reportedly ice in these corners, which makes
    the climbing much more enjoyable. If only the rock was better on this pitch, it would be a four star climb.

    At the top of the couloir, continue up and right on a broad snow covered ledge. A short climb to the left leads to the exit notch on the
    northeast ridge. Alternatively, one can continue up more 5th class mixed terrain on the northeast ridge
    all the way to the true summit.
