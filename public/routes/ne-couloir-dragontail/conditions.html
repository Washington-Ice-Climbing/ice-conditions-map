    This route is a completely different beast in the fall versus springtime. In the fall, you will encounter tenuous
    runout mixed climbing, an overhung chockstone, and plenty of alpine ice. In the spring, it is simply a snow
    climb until the final corner. Late fall definitely creates more technical conditions. In spring, the couloir has even been skied.

    There seem to be certain autumns when the final mixed corners ice up, providing more secure and higher quality climbing.
    It likely takes very specific conditions - an early wet, low elevation snowfall to create a water source, and then extended freeze-thaw
    in November - to ice up the corners, but if they are in, this immediately becomes a four star climb.

    In winter and early spring, flotation is helpful on the approach. The Stuart Lake road will be gated at Icicle Creek
    Road sometime after the first significant snowfall.
