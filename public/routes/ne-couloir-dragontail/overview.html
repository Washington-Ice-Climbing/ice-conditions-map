    In the realms of Cascade ice climbing, Triple Couloirs on Dragontail Peak is legendary. However, just out of sight,
    around the corner, lies a far more adventurous couloir climb: the Northeast Couloir. This 1500 ft gash
    in the side of Dragontail is everything
    a couloir should be - steep, narrow, and sustained. From the moment you enter its jaws, there is no rest from this beast.

    For the first 1000 ft, the couloir winds up a tight funnel, climbing 60 degree neve, fun mixed moves, and quality
    alpine ice. But the final 400 ft to reach the end of the couloir is technical, crumbly, and largely unprotectable. To say
    that the climbing here is desperate might be an understatement. The northeast couloir of Dragontail is the best
    and worst of alpine climbing in the state. Regardless, few routes in the Stuart Range, let alone the entire Cascades,
    can feel so full-on from top to bottom. This one is an adventure you will not soon forget.
