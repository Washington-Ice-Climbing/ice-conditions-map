        "With Porter toiling with the upper pitchees, out of sight from the belay, there was plenty of time for Kyle
        and I to think about the position we were in. Under a shower of gravel from the awful rock above, the route
        felt remote and isolated. It was convenient that the conditions on this route (though a bit thin) lined up
        with a time when nobody was in the Enchantments. A long route, committing mixed climbing, and the basin all to ourselves
        made this route the whole hotdog."
