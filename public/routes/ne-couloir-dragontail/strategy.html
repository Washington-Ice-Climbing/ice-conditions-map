    Although it makes for a long day, this climb can be easily done car to car in the fall by hiking the approach trail
    in the dark. Since November is after Enchantment Permit Season, one could have a nice camp at Colchuck Lake.

    If flotation was used on the approach, it would probably make most sense to leave behind for the climb. The descent
    is pretty short and direct and not having skis or snowshoes on your pack while climbing is nice.
