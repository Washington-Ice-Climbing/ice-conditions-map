    Once on the north ridge, climb moderate snow or neve up the crest of the ridge for about 1000 ft. Then start to
    trend left towards to ice lobe hanging down the ridge. Surmounting this ice wall at 9600 ft is the crux of the climb.

    There are many variations to this ice wall and it varies year to year, month to month. Generally, tackling the ice wall
    straight on can yield 30+ meters of full-on vertical AI4, but easier options exist down left and up and right. Perhaps the easiest
    variation is way down and left around the corner and goes at AI2 or so.
    Another easier variation climbs a weakness on the right, through some mixed terrain.
    Most parties report 60 meters or so of actual ice climbing, although
    usually the ice is vertical or near vertical for only a fraction of that length.

    Above the ice cliff, the angle eases off a little and becomes entirely snow. Finally, at 10600 ft, there is a final
    difficulty: the bergschrund. In earlier season, it is usually bridged, but during later season, you might have
    to look for a bypass to the left or right.

    After the bergschrund, a gentle stroll across the summit crater leads to the true summit on the east side.
