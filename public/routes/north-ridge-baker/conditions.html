    This route is an anomaly in that it can theoretically be climbed in any month of the year and has been climbed
    in most of months, if not all. However, the nature of the route changes greatly. During winter and spring months,
    the route is mostly a simple snow climb with a single ice pitch. During late summer, there is much more neve and
    crampon frontpointing. Additionally, the glacier becomes increasingly more difficult to navigate in the summer and fall.
    This is likely the main deterrent for most parties later in the season. However, some climbers are seeking that exact
    routefinding, adventurous experience.

    The crux ice wall varies in quality greatly. In colder spells, it could be very brittle and hard to get penetration.
    On warmer days, it might be soft hero ice.

    Access to the Heliotrope road is almost never restricted and snowmobiles frequent it in the winter. It is usually
    possible for a normal car to drive close to the trailhead by late April.

    The are notable avalanche concerns on this climb. The slope to gain the north and Roman Wall are exposed. The north ridge
    itself is certainly steep enough and broad enough to avalanche, although ridges tend to shed and are generally safer.
    Remember that this is a 10,781 ft volcano. It can see
    fresh snow at any time of year and might not show similar avalanche characteristics to lower elevations where you
    may frequently ski or climb.
