    For the descent, follow the Coleman-Deming ascent route. This begins with a descent of the Roman Wall, the steepest
    part of the descent. At the Colfax/Baker col, turn north and descend down the Coleman Glacier. As the glacier becomes
    more broken up, it is usually easier to stay skier's left on the glacier.

    Continue down to the Heliotrope trail or the Grouse Creek drainage, if it is still snow covered. In good weather, this descent
    is usually very fast, especially with skis.
