    In the North Cascades, no other peak matches the grandeur of Mt. Baker, also known by the natives as Koma Kulshan.
    The North Ridge is an iconic moderate alpine ice route that splits the north side, much like Liberty Ridge
    on Mt. Rainier, but on a smaller scale. It has become one of the more popular ice routes in the Cascades because
    of its easy access and moderate climbing.

    This route is known for its infamous ice wall: the only real technical challenge on route. Some find it cruiser;
    others get more than they bargained for. Regardless, nearly all climbers walk away with an appreciation for a climb
    that, while not the most interesting technically, is set in a truly stunning position in the North Cascades.
