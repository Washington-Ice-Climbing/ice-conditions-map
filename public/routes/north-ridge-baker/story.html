        "I was soloing the North Ridge with Peter L. I got over the ice step, and looked back.
        I kept waiting, but he just never showed up. I eventually downclimbed to where I could yell to him
        and realized he was in over his head. Whoops. So I made an anchor and lowered a rope to give a belay
        through the crux step. That crux may be short, but boy, it is sweet!"
