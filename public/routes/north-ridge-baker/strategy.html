    Most parties climbs this route car to car in 10-14 hours. The approach across the Coleman Glacier is often
    the crux of the entire route and should only be done in daylight.

    With the exception of the ice wall, the climbing is moderate enough that most parties will probably solo
    the bulk of the route. One could simul climb the crux, but it is short enough and steep enough that pitching it out
    makes more sense for most people.

    There are good camp options around 6000 ft at the base of the Coleman Glacier and slightly higher.

    Flotation is usually helpful on the approach through May. The fastest car to car conditions are undoubtedly
    April to May when the Grouse Creek approach is filled in with snow, allowing for minimal hiking. The North Ridge
    has even been done in under 5 hours car to car in good conditions.
