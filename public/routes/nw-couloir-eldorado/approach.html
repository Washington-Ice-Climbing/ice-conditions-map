    Begin at the Eldorado parking lot on the Cascade River Road. Find a way across the river (log crossing usually, but
    could be forded in the fall) and find the climber's trail on the other side. This trail climbs steeply for about 2000
    ft before reaching the infamous "boulder field". There is indeed a semblance of a trail through the terrible boulders
    if you closely follow the cairns. This torture continues for another 1000 ft.

    At about 6200 ft in the Eldorado Creek drainage, cross the ridge to climber's left and descend about 100 ft down
    a class 2-3 gully into the Roush Creek drainage. Possible camps are here or higher on the Inspiration Glacier. Around
    7000 ft, you will step onto the Eldorado Glacier. Beware of crevasses.
    At 7500 ft step onto the amazing flat "football field" of the Inspiration
    Glacier. Aim directly to cross the east ridge of Eldorado at the base around 7500 ft, then begin trending NW
    across the glacier to the col between Eldorado and Dean's Spire at 8000 ft.

    At the col, you should find a rappel station. A 60 m rappel or two shorter rappels should get you down
    to snow, which you can usually downclimb. If doing two shorter rappels, be prepared to find or replace the intermediate anchor.
    Beware of a bergschrund. Another rappel (beyond 60 m) may be required to rappel
    over the bergschrund, if open, which it might be in early season conditions.
    Then, turn south and walk a few minutes over to the base of the NW Ice Couloir.
