    Each party climbs this route differently, so there is no standard pitch breakdown. Most parties report 5-7 pitches
    if fully belayed or 2-3 longer simul-climbing blocks. There is generally only one way up the couloir, so route
    finding is straightforward.

    Many early season trip reports mention a chockstone crux that requires a few vertical mixed moves partway through
    the couloir. Most of the route is steep snow and neve with 4-5 vertical steps of 10-20 ft.
    Depending on the season, these crux steps might be mixed, thin ice, or thicker ice.

    Throughout the climbing, belays can be found in the rock walls or, if you happen to get it in fat conditions,
    thick ice.

    The route tops out at a flat patch of snow just below the summit. Continue up the final 50 ft of the kinfe edge
    to the true summit.
