    This route has been climbed in every month from October to May, which is over half the year, incredibly.
    The high elevation, northern aspect, and constant water source from glacial melt at the top of the couloir give
    great longevity to this route. However, relatively few parties report the route to be "in condition", so ideal
    conditions can be rather elusive. Many parties report thin, unprotectable ice, frequent sluffing, airated ice on top of snow,
    verglas, and other Cascade "ice" impostors.

    In late fall, the route can be quite mixed in nature. A strong fall storm that dumps snow at the higher elevations,
    followed by freeze thaw, can fatten the ice in the couloir. In winter and springtime, the climb usually is
    less technical and more of a sustained steep snow climb, although there are usually still some vertical steps.

    The approach is best done either when completely dry below 5000 ft or sufficient snow coverage. During in-between
    seasons like late fall with a foot of fresh snow at 4k or rapid melting in the spring, the boulder field can be a real
    pain. Not a dealbreaker, but it will make you truly question how much you want the route.

    As always, watch for avalanches and crevasse danger, especially after fresh snowfall in the fall.
