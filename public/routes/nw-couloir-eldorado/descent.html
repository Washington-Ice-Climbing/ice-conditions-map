    From the summit ridge, simply walk down the east ridge and back across the Inspiration Glacier like the way you
    came up. Try not to get lost in the boulder field in the dark.

    If you had to bail on the route, you could likely reascend back up to the col between Dean's Spire and Eldorado via
    some loose, but manageable climbing.
