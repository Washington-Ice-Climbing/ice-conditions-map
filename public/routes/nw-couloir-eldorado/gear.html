    The optimal rack for this route varies greatly depending on season. Generally, in the fall most parties use
    a rack of small to mid sized cams and nuts, a few pins, and a few screws. In super fat conditions, like November
    2019, we climbed the route entirely on ice screws except for one rock belay, using 7 screws in total. In spring time,
    parties generally use less protection but report a few screws are still helpful then.

    Double 60m ropes are helpful, but not needed on the rappel. The route is very straightforward, so the advantage of
    double ropes is somewhat lost there. Bringing a single rope could save weight, just be prepared to potentially
    replace the intermediate anchor or find your own. We simply slung a horn there.
