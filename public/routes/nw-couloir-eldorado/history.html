    Eldorado is a frequently visited peak, but its NW Ice Couloir is relatively hidden from most other peaks.
    Dan Cauthorne and Dan Pilling, two early Cascade ice climbing pioneers, were looking for ice one day
    around the SW Buttress of Dorado Needle. When they turned around, they were stunned by the perfect north facing
    couloir on Eldorado. In October 1986, they made the first ascent of the route. It would be almost another 20 years
    before the route saw a second ascent, despite many attempts.
