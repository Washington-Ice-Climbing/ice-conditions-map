    The NW Ice Couloir of Eldorado Peak has all the makings of a classic: an iconic peak, year round access,
    a northern aspect, and high quality climbing. For all the reasons listed above, it has been a highly sought
    after route for the Cascade alpinist ever since the first ascent in 1986.

    As with so many Cascade ice climbs, an attempt is rolling the dice with conditions. Many climbers attempt this route
    multiple times before truly getting it "in condition." When the ice is fat, word spreads like wildfire and climbers
    from all around the PNW huff and puff up the vertical mile into the magical land of ice and granite on the Eldorado Icecap.
    This route is a truly a gift to Cascade Ice Climbers, and must be on everyone's tick list.
