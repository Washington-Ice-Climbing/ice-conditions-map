        "Near disaster struck when 360 meters up my partner lost a crampon following a pitch.
        I led the next pitch but he insisted on swinging the lead through the final half pitch to a flat spot below the summit.
        We climbed the final knife-edge to the summit then hurried back to the tent,
        packed up and raced to the car against fading daylight. We lost the race and got lost in the last talus field.
        After tripping and making a full somersault and landing on my pack I decided to nap
        while my partner kept searching for the trail.
        He eventually found the easy trail and we were motoring home that night."
