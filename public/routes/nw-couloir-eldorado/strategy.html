    This route is approached often as an overnight, but can be climbed car to car by faster parties who can navigate
    the approach in the dark. The author here climbed the route car to car in 11.5 hours in perfect November conditions
    with a dry approach, and then firm snow up high. However, 16-18 hours is more common for a single push.
    Be sure to track your route on the way up in case you have to
    descend in the dark.

    There are multiple good camp options:
    <ul>
        <li>at the entrance to Roush Creek Basin around 6200 ft.</li>
        <li>when entering onto the Inspiration Glacier around 7500 ft.</li>
        <li>at the base of the east ridge of Eldorado around 75000 ft.</li>
    </ul>
    Note that any camping requires a permit from North Cascades National Park.

    In the winter, the road isn't usually gated, but snow can make it difficult to drive all the way to the trailhead.
    By late March however, the road is usually drivable. In winter and springtime, flotation is helpful on the approach.
    The east ridge of Eldorado is a 50 classic ski descent, if that's your kind of thing.
