    Usually, the approach begins where the Mountain Loop Highway intersects Forest Service Road 4096
    around an elevation of 1400ft. The road isn't gated to this point, but it also is not plowed,
    so hopefully some Darrington locals have driven it and packed down snow. It is a good idea to bring
    along a saw.

    Skin or hike up the road, stepping over annoying blowdowns. The entrance of the trail into the woods comes on the
    left before the end of the road and is flaggeed with pink tape usually. Follow the trail up the valley. As long
    as coverage is decent, there should be minimal schwackery. You will cross a few open paths.
    Around 3600 ft, the forest opens up more. Continue up towards the head of the valley, staying slightly climber's left of center.

    Around 4100 ft, you will enter a large clearing with a large slide path coming down from the left. You can ascend the
    slide path, but beware this is a major slide path that has scoured the land so deeply that it is impossible to exit this
    tube once you enter for another thousand feet. It essentially leads you to the base of Full Moon Fever, where you can
    cut hard right beneath the west face over towards the start of the route. Alternatively, the safer approach will ascend
    just climber's right of the slide path through open forest to the valley beneath the west face at 5200 ft. Somewhat exposed
    but scenic camping can be found here.

    To approach the first pitch directly, ascend SE up a snow gully coming down from the west spur ride of the west face of
    Sloan (the ridge that confines Bedal Basin). Alternatively, ascend lower angled slopes to the 5700 ft saddle on this
    spur ridge closest to Sloan. This can be a good place to leave skis/snowshoes if descending back around the mountain
    or down the route. Boot 300-400 ft up steep, annoyingly cliffy terrain to get to the start of the route, which is slightly left
    now of the ridge crest.
