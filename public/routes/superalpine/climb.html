    <b>Pitch 1:</b>
    There are a few different alternatives for the first pitch. The main goal is to get to the
    base of the obvious ice gully on the right side of the face.
    <ul>
        <li>
            The traditional first pitch (red line on topo) ascends from the north side of the spur ridge coming off the west face.
            It begins with some thin low angle ice before a crux 20-30 ft vertical WI4ish step. Above, there's a second
            WI3 step. Belay above this and then carry the ropes up moderate snow to the ice gully of the second pitch.
        </li>
        <li>
            An alternative (yellow line on topo) that bypasses the lower crux section is to climb directly up the spur ridge through easy mixed terrain.
            Then traverse left and climb the second half of the first pitch, the WI3 step. Continue up to second pitch.
            If you take this alternative, the entire route can go at WI3+.
        </li>
        <li>
            It appears that the gully could be accessed directly via a leftward sloping ice ramp that starts just climber's
            right of the spur ridge (SE face). During the first ascent, there was an ice flow spotted coming out of the ramp,
            likely a nice 30-40 ft of WI4 to start. The ramp itself would be lower angle, but we were unable to see it.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 2:</b>
    Climb ~60m of sustained WI3 starting on the left side of the gully and moving into the center. This pitch is the
    money pitch, with fat ice, sustained climbing, and good protection.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 3:</b> This pitch is about 100m and features steep snow with easier WI2-3 ice steps. Many teams
    will simul climb this. Near the end, you will see a snow ramp heading up and left, which gives you the option
    of skipping the final technical step and moving onto the upper face.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 4:</b> The final WI3+ pitch climbs a short steep curtain. Belay from screws in a flow off
    to the right above.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 5+:</b> Keep climbing steep, exposed snow for another 600 ft to the summit. These snowfields are incredibly
    exposed, so pay attention to little slab avalanches, which could have high consequence in this sort of terrain.
    To exit directly via the Corkscrew route, climb up to just right of a small tower on the south ridge of Sloan.
