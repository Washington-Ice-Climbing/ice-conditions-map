    The general season for this route is probably December to March, although not enough ascents have been made to accurately say.
    Ice has been observed on this face from November to April. To form the ice flows, there needs to be snow on the upper snowfields
    contributing to melt. The route enters the sun around noon and this would be damaging as temperatures rise in the spring, so the ice probably begins to fall apart
    in March usually. Peak snowpack is helpful to cover brush on the approach and reduce the amount of mixed climbing
    necessary on the approach, so that would be February-March on typical years.

    When watching specific day to day conditions, look for a period of no precipitation and cool temperatures. The ideal setup
    would be a rain/warmup event followed by a hard freeze, locking everything into place. The avalanche hazard overhead
    on the route is substantial, so patience waiting for the right window is paramount.
    During the first ascent, a large amount of spindrift was funneled down the ice gully, despite
    no snow in the previous few days. On the second ascent, no spindrift was observed, likely due to a strong wind event
    previously that scoured loose snow off the upper faces. However, they did run into touchy wind slabs up high. Beware
    of spindrift avalanches down the gully due to powder, wet loose, or windblown snow, so get on the route at first light.
