    The most straightforward descent option is to simply rappel the route, which is what the first two parties did.
    The main ice gully can be easily rappelled on V-Threads. The standard first pitch can be rappelled in two separate
    rappels off bushes with two 60 m ropes. Alternatively, make a single 60m rappel off to the SW on a rock anchor.
    this is likely the preferred method and was the choice of the second party.

    To do a carryover, ascend to the notch just right of the obvious towers on the south ridge of Sloan.
    To get to the Sloan Glacier, cut across the exposed south facing slope (green line). Then descend the Sloan Glacier, to the col on the north ridge
    of Sloan at 5300 ft, then back down into Bedal Basin.
    Another descent option (yellow line) is to take a leftward downward trending snow ramp on the south face. Then cross back across
    a col at 6550 ft on the south ridge of Sloan and back to the west spur ridge at 5700 ft.
