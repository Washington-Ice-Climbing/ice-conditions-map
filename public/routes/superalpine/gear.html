    An adequate rack would consist of 6-8 screws and a few small rock pieces (cams and nuts ok). Pickets could protect
    sections of snow, but there is generally enough ice to build screw anchors. Bring a V-Thread tool and bail cord to
    rappel the route. Unless very specific conditions are present, flotation is needed for the approach.
