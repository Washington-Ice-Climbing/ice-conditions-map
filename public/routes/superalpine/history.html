    Ever since the John Scurlock published images of the west face in winter in 2004, Sloan
    was a sought after objective. Alex Krawarik, author of the Washington Ice guidebook, made multiple attempts
    on the steeper lines on the west face, but never got the right conditions. In 2011, a party
    climbed the line of weakness on the NW Face, circling around the steepest part of the west face.
    The route was name Full Moon Fever.

    On February 28th 2019, Porter McMichael and Kyle McCrohan made an attempt on the right hand gully
    of the west face, the line that would become Superalpine. They approached in the dark and started
    climbing around sunrise. Around 11 am, Kyle was leading the final technical step when he fell approximately
    30ft on rotten, steep ice. His face slammed into the ice, breaking some bones in his cheek and knocking him
    unconscious. They rappelled down the face. A helicopter was unable to pick them up because of high
    winds and an impending storm, so Porter and Kyle managed to ski and walk back to the car.

    Two weeks later, Porter McMichael returned with Tavish Hansen. Porter led the final pitch where Kyle
    fell and they moved onto the steep snow of the west face. They joined the Corkscrew Route but turned around
    a few hundred feet short of the summit as wind slabs were threatening to sweep them off the steep face.
    They rapped down the route again.
