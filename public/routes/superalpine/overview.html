    At first glance, the west face of Sloan Peak looks like something out of the Rockies -
    steep, terraced, and loaded with free hanging ice pillars. This is certainly a unique face in the
    Cascades, forming massive lines that could be world class, if they were only climbed.

    Superalpine climbs
    the weakness on the right side of the face, ascending a thousand feet of ice and steep snow.
    From there, it still is another 600 ft of exposed, in-your-face snow climbing to this grand summit.
    Compared to other moderate Cascade alpine ice routes (e.g. NW Ice Couloir of Eldorado),
    it is rather sustained and full-on from the start.
    While safe conditions can be tricky to get on this route, your patience will be rewarded with possibly
    the best moderate ice route on this side of the Rockies.
