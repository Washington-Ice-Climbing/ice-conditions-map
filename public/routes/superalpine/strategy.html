    If you're not confident on navigating the approach in the dark, you should consider approaching day one and camping
    near the meadows around 5000 ft. The campsites are not completely protected from avalanche danger on the face, so be
    considerate of conditions. The first few ascents were done in a single push, starting from the car around 2 am
    and getting to the base of the route near sunrise, 7 am. The climb should definitely begin close to sunrise because
    the afternoon sun on the upper west face typically increases avalanche hazard.

    The FA team carried skis up the route, enabling various descent options. However, the ease of rappelling down the route
    makes this probably the simplest option and then you do not have to carry skis over. The spur ridge at 5700 ft
    makes a convenient spot to leave skis.
