    Usually, the approach begins where the Mountain Loop Highway intersects Forest Service Road 4096
    around an elevation of 1400ft. The road isn't gated to this point, but it also is not plowed,
    so hopefully some Darrington locals have driven it and packed down snow. It is a good idea to bring
    along a saw.

    Skin up the road then up the valley to the base of the west face.
