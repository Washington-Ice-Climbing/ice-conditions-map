    There are a few different alternatives for the first pitch. The main goal is to get to the
    base of the obvious ice gully on the right side of the face.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 2:</b> Climb 60m of sustained WI3 starting on the left side of the gully and moving center.
    This is the money pitch. Belay from screws.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 3:</b> This pitch(es) is about 100m and features steep snow with easier ice steps. Many teams
    might simul climb this. Near the end, you will see a snow ramp heading out left, which gives you the option
    of skipping the final technical step and moving onto the upper face.

<p>
    <b>Pitch 4:</b> The final WI3+ pitch climbs a short steep curtain. Belay from screws in a flow off
    to the right above.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Pitch 5+:</b> Keep climbing steep, exposed snow for another 600 ft to the summit.
